# COSC 482 Homework #3 - 1
#
# This program is to produce 50 random circles (bubbles) that bounce around the screen. When a bubble hits
# the edge of the screen it should bounce off in a natural manner. The point colors and the inside color are
# to be chosen at random. The initial starting point of each bubble and its direction and speed are also to be
# chosen at random.
#
# Stores the position of the circle to be rendered as well as its velocity. It should also have
# an update function that will take the elapsed time and adjust the circleâ€™s position for the next frame.
# The graphics engine will ask this controller class for the position so it can set and load the matricies
# to the shaders.
