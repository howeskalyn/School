# This example is an extension of some of the 2-D shader examples for the course. It graphs the Mandelbrot Set
# and other sets in the same family, z^n+c for n = 2, 3, 4, ..., 10.  There are many user interface options
# that allow for color scheme changes and set parameter changes.
#
# User Options
#
# Keyboard Options
#
# - Escape + Alt:  Ends the program.
# - D: Toggles the precision between single and double.
